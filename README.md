# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project to use different machine learning methods to review loan data to analyze lending risk -- and to ascertain the differences in the methods. Using Python and the SciKit Library to build and evaluate several models, the results below reveal the varriation in model outcomes and predicted risk. The final summary compares the strengths and weakness of each model.

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
